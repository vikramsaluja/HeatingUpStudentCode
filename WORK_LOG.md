| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Jan 13  | 7:20-8:20pm |                                                              During this time I started thinking about how if I could approach this problem set by using some of the different tools/algorithms that we have already learnt. Specifically if I could use a TST or a graph theory but I could not figure out how either of them could apply to this problem set. With the TST I tried to see if I could input each tempreture as a node. I also began to write out a way that I might approach this problem set by simply iterating through just to get some ideas down. |
| Jan 14  | 1:05-1:25pm |                                                                                                                               During this time after Mr. Blick's hint that we should use graph theory as his explanation I am trying to think of how I could think about with nodes and edges instead of a different way. Now that I have a hint towards graph theory I think that I have a better idea since I previously did not understand how this would apply to the problem set. I have written out some psudocode of just setting up the graph theory algorithm. |
| Jan 14  | 4:30-5:30pm | During this time I continued to think about using graph theory. My thinking is that if I have a graph with the tempretures as nodes and each trend as an edge then I can try and count the number of continous edges (similar to what we talked about in class). In order to build off of this I wonder if I use either bfs or dfs iterate through the graph and track the edges that make it through to find the longest warming trend. I think that with this algorithm it would take up a lot of time and memory especially as the number of temperatures increases. |
| Jan 15  | 5:00:5:15pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                               During this time I continued to think about how to use graph theory but I don't think that I can use bfs or dfs because I am not sure how that will accomplish the goal of this problem set. Originally I thought that it would help me find the longest trend but it would go through and check nodes instead of edges when that is really what we want. |
| Jan 19  | 4:00-4:45pm |                                                               During this time I began to think of the problem set by using a directed graph since that is what we went over in class. After learning memoization I was not sure if I wanted to approach this problem recursvely. But my thinking became solidified once I started to attempt the problem I remembered about adding one to the previously longest trend, using recusrision was the clearest way for me to think about approaching the problem. I set up my base case and my variables during this time. |
| Jan 20  | 9:15-9:35pm |                                                                              During this time I began to more fully implement my recursive algorithm to find the longest trend of increasing tempreturs. At first I was having trouble with my longestPathTo method because I forgot how essential the memoization part of this problem set was. My thinking changed as I realized that I needed in incorporate an array for the memoization and utilize it in my LongestPathTo() method and this helped actually make my recurisive algorithm effective and efficient. |
| Jan 21  | 9:20-9:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                    During this time I fully completed the problem set. I continued to work on implementing my directed graph and recurisve algorithm. For the most part my code was complete but I was still facing one error as I forgot to intialize my path to start at 1. This had an extremely large effect on the outcome of my code and once I made this change my code passed all of the tests. |
