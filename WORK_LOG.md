| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |

Specifically if I could use a TST or a graph theory but I could not figure out how either of them could apply to this problem set. With the TST I tried to see if I could input each tempreture as a node. I also began to write out a way that I might approach this problem set by simply iterating through just to get some ideas down. |

Now that I have a hint towards graph theory I think that I have a better idea since I previously did not understand how this would apply to the problem set. I have written out some psudocode of just setting up the graph theory algorithm. |
| Jan 14  | 4:30-5:30pm | During this time I continued to think about using graph theory. My thinking is that if I have a graph with the tempretures as nodes and each trend as an edge then I can try and count the number of continous edges (similar to what we talked about in class). In order to build off of this I wonder if I use either bfs or dfs iterate through the graph and track the edges that make it through to find the longest warming trend. I think that with this algorithm it would take up a lot of time and memory especially as the number of tempratures increases. |

Originally I thought that it would help me find the longest trend but it would go through and check nodes instead of edges when that is really what we want. |
